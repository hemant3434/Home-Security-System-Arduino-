# Home-Security-System-Arduino-
Home Security Alarm system using Arduino:<br />

Description: <br />
Two Individual Alarms working together as a cohesive system using motion sensors and bluetooth modules. <br />

How it works (Intuition):<br />
A person walks in front of one alarm and bluetooth module sends a signal to the other module and both the alarms ring, just like a
fire alarm system in a school. IR receiver is used to control the volume of alarms which is displayed on the LCD.

Parts Used: <br />
  Arduino Rev3,<br />
  PIR Motion Sensor,<br />
  Piezo Buzzer,<br />
  LCD (16x2) Display,<br />
  Bluetooth HC-05 Module (Master and Slave),<br />
  IR Receiver and Remote. <br />
<br />
<br />

Code Provided for both Master and Slave.<br />
Breadboard design and schematic are also uploaded.<br />
